4,I thought last year's Camp was very interesting I enjoyed all of the different talks and the food was great I wish we would have had a little bit more time to explore the area around  so the nature and with notes
4,I very much enjoyed Camp last year I thought they am location besides with the Great's every peaceful very quiet and I'm really enjoy the special events it's great to be out in the water fountain at 5th and around the region
4,I really enjoy the balance between topic work team work teamwork I relock the location it was great to be able to support activity after what I messed up a bit of a town to kind of hang out after we finish the day so I may be a location where we could go and spend some time in until I got two bars and restaurants would have been nice as well
4,I really like cam plus 2 year it was in very interesting lacation everyone were in the same place so it gave an opportunity to discuss topics and communicate with our colleagues as always spend lots of time together having fun there were lots of interesting talks with Compares that we that combination of top of teams which wire is rated Everest and interesting
4,so the cop come close to your leg District bus quite quite interesting  that was a really great location last Hotel amazing Lake nearby yeah all sorts of the same time was quite the cool on bottom the bedside I didn't have a chance to see some of them which I really wanted to  that was a good social events but I gain and same time the weather was for the crop so it was exciting interesting but at the same time part 2  yeah and it was amazing pretty how was one of the best breakdance ever
4,Camp last year was  I really enjoyed that sleep but that was that person comes the location was really nice being right by the lake place to have brunch islands around exploring the area plus ways to get lost  nice being off the grid for a while but sometimes that meant that the kind of Internet and phone signal wasn't so good the food was fantastic but drinks could have been a bit Chica weather lovely weather must much of the time when we first got it was a bit rainy which cut down on the first few days but generally recent pictures weather
4,enjoyed I really enjoyed Camp last time it was a great experience however it did feel a little bit remote but it was nice having it will that peace and quiet the food was great and the rooms were excellent stain so I would definitely go back but for a very isolated holiday
4,okay so last year I found the amounts of time spent on topic teams wasn't long enough but I think the teams did was was good I think I enjoyed the lighting Tilton I enjoyed the different formats of the wheel Cafe in Salem I think the events on the documents night was really good and I'm at the restaurant was goods and a soda combinations very good the hotel rooms are very nice an expensive sports in the management team together was quite the event
4,there were too many talks last year which made it more difficult actually do stuff when we didn't have enough time for top of things  the Fishbowl session was if it's congratulations as opposed to being protective what we actually want to take detox themselves where more realistic and people were discussing the issues we have at the company and in general for the technical side of it  that he was a very supportive environment so they could try things after
4,Camp last year was amazing have it was very easily reachable at the location was good and it was an important Focus for new join us too  experience to Focaccia I particularly enjoyed Camp X keynote took away a lot from from the keynote the only thing I did not like was the smell in the meeting rooms
4,what time last year was good it was quite intense learning over there. Thing is it's not in the city so we don't get much to explore around already enjoy.
4,the countryside with beautiful butts  the surroundings were culturalist
4,monsters was a lovely location
4,I found Camp last year enjoyable too much food and the Dubai the wasn't as nice but all in all I think we learned a lot and I had a good time
4,I'm at the hotel was really good and I like the like the straight then it was getting rained on the whole time
0,my overriding memory is it was smelly there was a really bad smell toilets in the the meeting rooms and it was hard to focus on what we were doing just cuz of the other parents
4,perfect thank you so much
4,Camp last year has been different and very exciting  but  I guess location could have been better
4,I'm lost you can for as well one of my favorite I'm not that I don't see many of my favorite first of all because he was in UK so you know you know you know need to take flies that can be delayed or cancelled on the train runs very smooth move the location itself was beautiful or the hotel or just wonderful I love my bed especially that the subject for the topic teams were really engaging they was they were very useful for me also who won The Mill at the restaurant that mean everything was wonderful it really was one of the best cancer but ended
4,Android can't find match last year I thought it was well-organized I didn't think that the organizers that the hotel did a very good job of cleaning up the smell in some of the conference rooms which is empty they didn't actually admits there was two steffel get rid of it and I was worried about going back there this year for the management meeting which we are but maybe it's better than the beer smell we had the year before
4,so am I thoroughly enjoyed most positive last year the social activities were right the smell in the hotel not-so-great the views fantastic General content on the young conference was actually something that was really interesting and really open my eyes to something like that convenient do for people older than not yet great time
4,venue was very good the facilities were excellent places easy to defined  the outside guest was very good  the lack of structure made it very difficult to quantify the learning  I was very challenging to  decide what was actually what was actually afterwards
0,Camp Ozark hey I had a lot of fun on the Dow but the food was on the food is great but company was awful
4,really nice views good social activities nice restaurants  low had the main dinner in the middle of nowhere no shops around  nice landscapes and
0,so things I enjoyed about Camp the marketplace being able to cross pollinate across different topic teams and $7 in 2 weeks when I didn't like was the that was quite remote location already much to do off to the day had ended
